Work Order Tracker MVP - AI Prompt Summary
-------------------------------------------

Project Overview:
We're developing a new module called the **Work Order Tracker**, which will function alongside an existing **Pick Tracker** module. Both will be accessed from a central "Work Center" selector screen where the user picks which workflow to begin. This system is being designed for warehouse/millwork operations with a touchscreen-friendly interface.

Purpose of This Mockup:
This mockup is a **non-functional proof of concept** to demonstrate the core flow and user experience of the Work Order Tracker module. It is intended for internal review by the Millwork Manager before development proceeds.

Tech Stack (MVP):
- HTML/CSS/JS (touchscreen optimized)
- Flask or similar backend (future phase)
- SQL database (PostgreSQL preferred in production)

Core Workflow:
1. **Main Page** – User selects the work center (Pick Tracker or Work Order Tracker).
2. **User Selection Page** – User taps their name to begin.
3. **Open Work Orders Page** – Displays any open (in-progress) work orders for the user.
4. **New Work Order Input Page** – User enters or scans a Sales Order barcode.
5. **Work Order Selection Page** – The system retrieves matching work orders tied to the barcode.
   - User checks the items they will begin picking.
   - Tapping "Start" sends them back to the Open Work Orders screen with the new ones listed.

Future Integration:
- This module will reuse backend logic and structure from the Pick Tracker where possible.
- A shared login/session system will eventually allow picker continuity across modules.
- Barcode scan will trigger dynamic DB queries for linked work orders.
- Work orders will be stored in a new table similar to the existing picks table.

Current State:
The included HTML file represents a mockup of the full user flow using placeholder data.
All UI components are touchscreen-friendly and ready to be wired to real data and endpoints.
